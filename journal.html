Entry 1</p>
<p>
I am a bit behind on everything after missing one day of class (sorry about that). I really want to make my site have a hover and drop down panel that shows my menu bar. The GIF finally moves when I hover over it! I havenâ€™t finished linking everything yet. I also hope to change the format a bit if needed as well as font size.

Entry 2

<p>
I caught up on my work! I managed to add links to my about me and projects. The GIF really works now. It wasn't working as well before. I want to get started on a project soon using code and being able to use different methods I have used in the past in order to make interesting projects. My idea for the gift card was to make one for my sister and my brother in law since they got married this month. I'm not sure if I should use a photo of them or draw it out yet. I do know that I want it to be in a card form and a few buttons that open up the letter, show text, and maybe a couple of images.
