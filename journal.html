Entry 1</p>
<p>
I am a bit behind on everything after missing one day of class (sorry about that). I really want to make my site have a hover and drop down panel that shows my menu bar. The GIF finally moves when I hover over it! I haven’t finished linking everything yet. I also hope to change the format a bit if needed as well as font size. 
</p>
<p>
Entry 2
</p>
<p>
I caught up on my work! I managed to add links to my about me and projects. The GIF really works now. It wasn't working as well before. I want to get started on a project soon using code and being able to use different methods I have used in the past in order to make interesting projects. My idea for the gift card was to make one for my sister and my brother in law since they got married this month. I'm not sure if I should use a photo of them or draw it out yet. I do know that I want it to be in a card form and a few buttons that open up the letter, show text, and maybe a couple of images.

<p>
I completed my first project. It’s a project that allows you to draw as the mouse moves. When you click different numbers the color of the brush changes.

Entry 4
</p>
<p>
I created a face filter of a person's face on fire. It's a bit hard to see with marks on but if you open your mouth a large tongue will come out. This is done by locating all the points on one's face and differentiating them based on the distance between each point. If the points on one's face match up to be the same as the template then the points will turn into small fires. Locating 2 certain points on one face allowed me to place the tongue over the code.

I want to go back to my painting project and allow the + and - button to increase and decrease the transparency of the size of the painting brush. I wonder if I can also set limits to make sure the size of the brush doesn't go over a certain number. Making a drawing game for people to pick words and draw based on them sounds fun but difficult to create. 
</p>
<p>
Entry 6
</p>
<p>
I want to go back to my projects and improve them. I want to go back to my drawing project and add a way to decrease or increase the size of the brush. I also want to create a few more projects using statistics. I also want to include one project for someone's birthday or a holiday or birthday themed project. 
</p>

Entry 7
</p>
<p>
I created a valentine’s day card that isn't really for anyone specific but was fun to pick out different images to use for my code. There was a previous project similar to this which helped me create what I wanted for my project. I added more hearts and slowed down the amount of time it would take for the hearts to move around so one could have more time to see the text. I need to center the text a bit better so that it fits on the hearts without changing the size of the hearts. I also noticed that some of my hearts are different sizes because of their image size so I’ll try and fix that. 
</p>

Entry 8
</p>
<p>
I fixed the valentines day card! I decided to add quotes to it since I enjoy adding quotes to different projects so that if anyone ever sees them it might make them feel a little bit better about themselves or their day. Of course that’s not always going to work but I personally find it helpful to have daily reminders that everything will be ok.

Entry 9

<p>
I picked out a song with Ellie to create a karaoke machine project. I picked my favorite Christmas song, Last Christmas. We went over the structure of how the code would work based on prior knowledge from previous classes and found a cohesive way to code the project. Ellie coded the whole project on her laptop since we worked on it on zoom and it's also on her website!

Entry 10

<p>
I haven’t updated in a while but I just completed my favorite project! It’s a project including all of my drawings this year at Dalton. I left a few out that were done at home for myself. A couple of my drawings can also be found on the Daltonian! I enjoyed creating this project because it allowed me to combine two of the things I enjoy; coding and drawing. In the future I hope to continue updating my website and adding all the drawings I complete over my time here at Dalton! Thank you Molly and everyone in my CS1 class for your endless amount of support and help this year! I’ll really miss this class. Good luck next year!
